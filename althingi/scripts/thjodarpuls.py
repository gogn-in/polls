Script to collect polling data from Gallup (n√© Capacent) and output it as CSV
to stdout.

Gallup store their polling data in a `dataset on DataMarket`_. Using the
`DataMarket API`_ we can download a CSV containing every poll since March 1994.

The script is written in Python 3 and has no dependencies.
